            <p>The intent of this user interface is to present the results of a statistical treatment of performance test data to identify performance regressions introduced into source code.  To do this, performance test data and the order of pushes to the product source code repository must be taken into account together. A number of groups at mozilla have contributed to this project in a variety of ways, if you're interested you can read all about it <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Signal_From_Noise/StatusNovember2012" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h4>Source of The Raw Data</h4>
            <p>The raw data used to generate the results displayed on this page are generated by <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos" target="_blank">talos</a>. The raw data can be accessed directly as JSON data using the <a href="http://datazilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/webservice/#test-data" target="_blank">datazilla web service</a>. Talos tests can have any number of pages associated with them.  For example, the Talos test <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests#tp5" target="_blank">tp5n</a> has a subset of the 100 most visited web pages from the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites" target="_blank">alexa topsite index</a> associated with it.  However, the tests run by Talos do not always contain full web pages, <a href="http://dromaeo.com/" target="_blank">dromaeo</a> is a test suite where the associated pages all test javascript performance and core DOM functionality. One thing all of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos#Talo    s_Tests" target="_blank">talos tests</a> have in common is they all measure performance. Different products like: Firefox, Fennec, and B2G may have different combinations of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos#Talos_Tests">talos tests</a> and test platforms (Mac, Win, Linux) associated with their test data.</p>

            <h4>Statistical Treatment of The Raw Data</h4>
            <p>A full description of the statistical treatment of the data, developed by the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Metrics" target="_blank">mozilla metrics department</a>, can be found <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/d/dd/Talos_Statistical_Analysis_Writeup.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In general, every page of each test suite, for each platform, for each new push is subjected to the statistical procedure described. The implementations of these statistical methods are located in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/datazilla-metrics" target="_blank">datazilla-metrics</a> repository.</p>

         <h3>Dashboard Panel</h3>
         <hr class="su-light-horz-line" style="margin-bottom:10px;" />
         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all su-vis-detail-panel su-text-background">
            <p>The dashboard panel consists of three sections from left to right: test results by test name, cumulative pass/fail results for all tests and platforms, and test results by platform.  This display is intended to look for pass/fail trends that are test or platform specific and give an overall assessment of how a particular revision's performance tests look.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all su-vis-detail-panel su-text-background">
            <p>The second panel on the page displays a grid of test and platform results. To the right of the grid is a table that displays the page specific metrics data associated with each cell of the grid. These two sets of test results allow a user to rapidly browse the test/platform combinations and all of their associated page results.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="su-help-grid"></div>
         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all su-vis-detail-panel su-text-background">
            <p>The rows of the grid displayed above represent different <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos#Talos_Tests" target="_blank">talos tests</a> and the columns represent different platforms.  A color gradient is run from orange to green, where complete orange indicates 0% of the tests passed and pure green indicates 100% of the tests passed.  Gray cells indicate no data was available for that test and platform combination.  When the cursor is placed over a defined cell the corresponding test page results are loaded in the table to the right. The grid cells can be clicked to lock the table on a particular set of test/platform page results.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all su-vis-detail-panel su-text-background">
            <p>The table displayed above contains the metrics data associated with a particular grid cell. Each row represents an individual page associated with a particular test/platform combination.  A checkbox is available for each row, when selected the test/platform/page series is loaded in the <a href="#pushlog">Pushlog Panel</a> below. Rows with a green background passed the associated performance test, rows with an orange background color failed. A detailed description of the statistical treatment of the raw data can be found <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/d/dd/Talos_Statistical_Analysis_Writeup.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <h4>Table Column Descriptions</h4>
            <p><b>page</b> - The name of the page tested.</p>
            <p><b>p/f</b> - pass/fail result indicated by the false discovery rate algorithm</p>
            <p><b>mean</b> - The mean of the replicates associated with the test.</p>
            <p><b>trend mean</b> - The value of the trend mean used in the t-test comparison with the mean.</p>
            <p><b>std</b> - The standard deviation of the replicates for the test.</p>
            <p><b>trend std</b> - The standard deviation of the replicates for the trend mean used in the comparison.</p>
            <p><b>p value</b> - The calculated probability returned by welchs t-test.  The source producing this value can be examined <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/datazilla-metrics/blob/master/dzmetrics/ttest.py#L7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p><b>h0 rejected</b> - The null hypothesis result.  A value of false indicates that the means of the two populations of replicates are equal and the null hypothesis is accepted. A value of true indicates the difference between the means of the two populations of replicates is statistically significant. The source producing this value can be examined <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/datazilla-metrics/blob/master/dzmetrics/ttest.py#L7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p><b>replicates</b> - The total number of replicate values associated with the test.</p>
            <p><b>compared to</b> - The last revision incorporated into the trend mean and trend standard deviation before this revision. The replicates from the <i>compared to</i> revision were used in the t-test comparison.</p>

         <div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all su-vis-detail-panel su-text-background">
            <p>The pushlog panel displays an ordered list of pushes to the repository from left to right.  Each point displayed on the chart is the mean of a set of replicates for a test/page/platform combination for a particular repository push.</p>

            <p><b>Top Control Panel</b></p>
            <p>The control panel above the plot of means provides two functions: changing the way the trend mean data is graphically depicted and allowing the user to retrieve different ranges of pushes to examine.  The option menu allows the user to change the fit of the trend line. The begin and end entry boxes enable a user to specify how many pushes before and after the target push to retrieve.</p>

            <p>This control panel works in conjuction with selecting a range directly on the chart.  A range of mushes can be selected by clicking and dragging the cursor on the chart.  The first and last revision in the range will be auto populated in the begin and end entry boxes below.  The get range button takes you to a mercurial web page depicting all of the changests between the revision selected.</p>
