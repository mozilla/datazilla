    Implements the Benjamini-Hochberg method of false discovery rate control.

    Code by Joseph Kelly, Mozilla metrics.

    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate

    Given a list of p-values (floats) for independent comparisons, and a q
    value (the upper bound on the false discovery rate; the expected proportion
    of false rejections of the null hypothesis), returns a dictionary with two
    keys: "status" is a list of boolean values the same length as the given
    list of p-values, where a ``True`` value represents rejection of the null
    hypothesis for that p-value and ``False`` represents acceptance of the null
    hypothesis, and "count" is the number of p-values for which the null
    hypothesis was rejected (these will always be the lowest "count" p-values).
